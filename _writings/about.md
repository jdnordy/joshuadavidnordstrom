I was introduced to programming while in grad school and I was hooked. Four years later, I am a software engineer currently focused on full-stack web development. I recently developed and deployed [Nautilus](https://jdnordstrom.com/writings/nautilus), an Electron desktop application built with React and D3 that visualizes a Docker Compose instance.

Currently, I'm working as a Full-Stack Web Developer for Green Street, a firm providing commercial real estate research, analytics, and most recently, news via a comprehensive web application. Our tech stack includes:
- [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), a PHP web application framework.
- Vue and Vuex for the frontend
- Docker
- AWS
- Webpack
- Python and Node.js for internal applications


[This website](https://jdnordstrom.com/writings/this-website) functions as my personal portfolio and an archive of musings as I continue growing as an engineer--always learning, problem solving, and evolving in accord with the ever changing landscape of web technology. See the code behind the site [here](https://github.com/jdnordy/joshuadavidnordstrom).

## What I'm Learning

Here's a few things that I am currently learning...

- Amazon [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and serverless computing--to be used in a simple notification application I'm building.
- Critical Theory and how it speaks to race relations in America today.
